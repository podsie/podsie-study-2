| Level ()                 | \*        | A _Dataset Level_. An example of the correct use of this column heading is `Level (Unit)`, where "Unit" is the dataset level **title** and the value in the column is the level **name** (e.g., "Understanding Fractions"). The Level column should always be of the format `Level (level_title)`. The level title must be ≤ 100 characters and consist of letters, numbers, dashes, underscores, and spaces. If a dataset level title is not included, it will become "Default". Multiple Level columns are OK.                                                                                                   | ≤ 100                   |

| Problem View             |           | The number of times the student encountered the problem so far. This counter increases with each instance of the same problem. If this column is not provided you must provide the **Problem Start Time**; it will be used to determine the Problem View. If both are provided, but it is determined that they do not agree, the Problem View will not be recomputed.                                                                                                                                                                                                                                              |                         |
| Problem Start Time       |           | The time the problem is shown to the student. Must be given in one of the standard time formats [1]. This column is used to determine the **Problem View** if it is not given. If both are provided, but it is determined that they do not agree, the Problem View will not be recomputed.                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                         |                         |
| Step Name                | †         | The name of a discrete problem-solving step. Include a step name for a transaction if the transaction also has a Tutor Response Type and an Outcome. Otherwise, _Attempt At Step_ will not be calculated.                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                          | ≤ 255                   |
| Attempt At Step          |           | **DataShop ignores the values in this column when processing the import file**. "Attempt at Step" is computed from the rest of the transaction data, but only if _Step Name_ is provided.                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                          |                         |

| Condition Type           |           | A condition classification. Must always be paired with Condition Name, even if a condition does not have a condition type. Multiple Condition Type columns are OK. If Condition Type is specified, Condition Name must have a value as well.                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                       | ≤ 255                   |
| KC ()                    |           | A knowledge component. An example of the correct use of this column heading could be `KC (Area)`, where 'Area' is the KC model name for that knowledge component. The **KC** column should always be of the format `KC (kc_model_name)`. The model name must be ≤ 50 characters and consist of letters, numbers, dashes, underscores, and spaces. If a KC model name is not included, the name will default to "Default". Multiple KC columns are OK.                                                                                                                                                              | ≤ 65,535                |
| KC Category ()           |           | A _knowledge component category_. An example of the correct use of this column heading could be `KC Category (Area)`, where 'Area' is the KC model name for that knowledge component. The KC Category column should always be of the format `KC Category (kc_model_name)`. The model name must be ≤ 30 characters. If a KC model name is not included, the name will default to "Default". If including KC Category, be sure to pair it with a corresponding KC column by using the same KC model name. If you specify a KC Category value, a KC value must be given as well. Multiple KC Category columns are OK. | ≤ 50                    |

| CF ()                    |           | A custom Field. Use this element to describe other contextual information or a new variable not adequately captured by the other columns. An example of the correct use of this column heading could be `CF (Factor or add-m)`, where 'Factor or add-m' is the name for that custom field. The **CF** column should always be of the format `CF (custom_field_name)`. The custom field name must be ≤ 65,000 characters. If a custom field name is not included, the name will default to "Default". Multiple CF columns are OK.                                                                                   | ≤ 65,000                |
| Event Type               |           | Optional. Allowed values are: `assess`, `instruct` and `assess_instruct`; an empty value is interpreted as `assess_instruct`. The value in the **Event Type** column affects how the opportunity count is computed for the Student Step Rollup export. Values of `instruct` and `assess_instruct` cause the opportunity count to be incremented by 1. Value of `instruct` causes the Outcome column to be blank.                                                                                                                                                                                                   | ≤ 30                    |

### Notes

**†** At least one of _Step Name_, _Selection_, or _Action_ must have a value for each row.

**Bad Format:**
| Format | Example and Notes |
|--------|------------------|
| ~~`mm:ss.0`~~ | ~~`08:56.0`~~ <br>**This date-less format is the result of Excel applying its own formatting. You may see this format if you opened and saved a DataShop transaction export file in Excel, but didn't apply TEXT formatting to the columns while opening it. To correct it, you will need to find a copy of your file that has date information.** |

**[2] Column Pairs**

For columns that are required as pairs—**Condition Name** and **Condition Type**, or **KC** and **KC Category**—these columns must be listed in the order that they are paired. For example, if a dataset file has two condition columns, the column format would be Condition Name, Condition Type, Condition Name, Condition Type.
